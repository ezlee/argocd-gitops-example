    kubernetes.io/description: restricted-v2 denies access to all host features and
      requires pods to be run with a UID, and SELinux context that are allocated to
      the namespace. This is the most restrictive SCC and it is used by default for
      authenticated users. On top of the legacy 'restricted' SCC, it also requires
      to drop ALL capabilities and does not allow privilege escalation binaries. It
      will also default the seccomp profile to runtime/default if unset, otherwise
      this seccomp profile is required. This is a customized restricted-v2 scc.
